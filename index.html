    <h2>Introduction</h2>
    <p>
        My name is Christian Tran attending Southern New Hampshire University majoring in Computer Science for my Bachelor's degree. 
        I have practical expertise with database-driven applications, algorithms and data structures, and software engineering. I have 
        improved my capacity to create scalable systems and creating data-driven applications that are useful in the real world through 
        my courses and ePortfolio building. This portfolio demonstrates my improvement during the curriculum and my preparedness for a career 
        in software development.

    <h2>Code Review Overview</h2>
    <p>
        Completing my assignments for this semester has made me realize how crucial it is to evaluate and polish one's work professionally. 
        Increasing a program's capabilities, adding comments, and eliminating and rewriting needlessly complex code are all common steps in 
        this evaluation process. I have improved my artifacts throughout this semester by adding testing modules for secure coding, adding additional 
        methods for database CRUD functionality, and making the list search function for an appointment planner more complicated
    </p>
    <p>
        Working in a collaborative setting has also given me a greater appreciation for the opportunity to have my work reviewed by a different person.
        I frequently become too attached to a project and lose my capacity to examine it objectively, but having a second reviewer may point out errors 
        that I was unaware of and offer suggestions for potential fixes. The ability to interact with stakeholders and learn what they want from a project 
        has also been a focus of my work in this class, and it has strengthened my conviction that the most crucial stage of the software development lifecycle 
        is when the project's requirements are determined through discussion with stakeholders, programmers, project leads, and end users.

    <h2>Artifacts</h2>

    <div class="artifact">
        <h3>Algorithms and Data Structures – CS 320 Final Project</h3>
        <p>
            My final project from CS-320, which I finished in 2024, is the artifact for the software design and engineering category. This medical application is used to 
            make appointments, gather contact details, and present a list of things that need to be done. This class's objective was to finish an application that automated 
            the data collection process and offered module testing in the form of JUnit tests to ensure that the data submitted was accurate and did not cause errors like buffer overflow.
        </p>
        <p>
            This project was chosen because it effectively combines software application, data collecting, and testing. The artifact's junit tests, private helper methods, 
            suitable access modifiers, and parameter limitations demonstrate my capacity to create a logical, effective, and syntactically correct application. By extending the 
            scope of the search modules and junit tests, the artifact is enhanced.
        </p>
        <p>
            The assert true method that a variable was inside its anticipated parameters was the main focus of JUnit tests in the first project. 
            I added twice as many JUnit tests with an assert false function to check for data that wasn't covered by my previous tests. Additionally, new variables were added, 
            such as the first and last names to attach to the list that tracked my medical app's appointments. I included a number of other search techniques that applied to all 
            the other variables provided. Originally, this list was just intended to be used to seek for a unique identity by searching through the list. 
            The majority of the course goals were fulfilled for this item. My project's syntax was enhanced and its scope was broadened. As of right now, my outcome-coverage strategies have not been updated.
        </p>
        <p>
            When enhancing this project I learned to stay within the bounds of the project and not to become too ambitions. The areas of my project that I focused on seemed like they were 
            common sense improvements and extensions. It also helped that I hadn’t looked at my project for some months and could look at it with fresh eyes. The only challenges that I faced 
            were attempting to get tests to function properly and test the correct data.

        <h3>Databases – CS 340 Animal Rescue Dashboard</h3>
        <p>
            A project from CS-340 that was finished in 2024 used as the artifact for the databases category. 
            It is a Python file that serves as the back-end framework of an interactive database for animal rescue organizations 
            by interacting with Pymongo. While the post-enhancement artifact has more sophisticated SQL operations, the pre-enhancement 
            artifact only has basic CRUD capability.
        </p>
        <p>
            This project is a great illustration of how databases are built at the back end, which is why it was chosen as 
            my third artifact. Common languages like Python are used to search and edit the data in these databases. Significant 
            changes were made to my artifact throughout the enhancement phase, including the addition of create, read, update, and 
            delete SQL capability as well as other enhancements like count, insert multiple, update multiple, and delete multiple commands. 
            These improvements demonstrate how SQL and Python data structure code may be updated and expanded upon.
        </p>
        <p>
            For this milestone, I believe I have fulfilled all of the course goals. I added count, delete many, insert multiple, 
            and update multiple SQL commands to my artifact's capabilities and increased its complexity. As of right now, my outcome 
            coverage policies have not been update
        </p>
        <p>
            I gained an appreciation for both simple and sophisticated SQL commands while improving my project, particularly with 
            regard to CRUD (create, read, update, and delete). In my initial effort, I was able to establish a working database for 
            animal rescues by simply including those four SQL procedures into my Python code. I discovered how much a few tweaks may 
            improve my project's final design once I updated my code.

        <h3>Software Design and Engineering – 3D Office Scene</h3>
        <p>
            This artifact focuses on software architecture and graphical rendering using modular
            object-oriented design. The project demonstrates scene organization, rendering logic,
            and reusable components within a graphics application.
        </p>
        <p>
            It was chosen to represent my growth in software design principles, modularization, and
            maintainable code structures within a more complex system.

<section id="enhancements">
    <h2>Enhancements and Learning Outcomes</h2>
    <p>
        Across all artifacts, enhancements focused on improving efficiency, scalability, and user
        experience. In the algorithms artifact, I replaced list-based storage with hash maps to
        achieve constant-time lookups and implemented efficient sorting algorithms to improve data
        organization.
    </p>
    <p>
        For the database artifact, I expanded the project into a full-stack application by
        integrating a Flask backend with an interactive HTML and JavaScript frontend. This enabled
        real-time filtering, advanced querying, and data visualization using MongoDB.
    </p>
    <p>
        Through these enhancements, I strengthened my understanding of algorithmic analysis,
        database integration, full-stack development, and professional software engineering
        practices. These projects collectively demonstrate my readiness to design, analyze, and
        implement scalable computer science solutions.
