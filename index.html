    <h2>Introduction</h2>
    <p>
        My name is Christian Tran attending Southern New Hampshire University majoring in Computer Science for my Bachelor's degree. 
        I have practical expertise with database-driven applications, algorithms and data structures, and software engineering. I have 
        improved my capacity to create scalable systems and creating data-driven applications that are useful in the real world through 
        my courses and ePortfolio building. This portfolio demonstrates my improvement during the curriculum and my preparedness for a career 
        in software development.

    <h2>Code Review</h2>
    <p>
        Completing my assignments for this semester has made me realize how crucial it is to evaluate and polish one's work professionally. 
        Increasing a program's capabilities, adding comments, and eliminating and rewriting needlessly complex code are all common steps in 
        this evaluation process. I have improved my artifacts throughout this semester by adding testing modules for secure coding, adding additional 
        methods for database CRUD functionality, and making the list search function for an appointment planner more complicated
    </p>
    <p>
        Working in a collaborative setting has also given me a greater appreciation for the opportunity to have my work reviewed by a different person.
        I frequently become too attached to a project and lose my capacity to examine it objectively, but having a second reviewer may point out errors 
        that I was unaware of and offer suggestions for potential fixes. The ability to interact with stakeholders and learn what they want from a project 
        has also been a focus of my work in this class, and it has strengthened my conviction that the most crucial stage of the software development lifecycle 
        is when the project's requirements are determined through discussion with stakeholders, programmers, project leads, and end users.

    <h2>Artifacts</h2>

    <div class="artifact">
        <h3>Algorithms and Data Structures – CS 320 Final Project</h3>
        <p>
            My final project from CS-320, which I finished in 2024, is the artifact for the software design and engineering category. This medical application is used to 
            make appointments, gather contact details, and present a list of things that need to be done. This class's objective was to finish an application that automated 
            the data collection process and offered module testing in the form of JUnit tests to ensure that the data submitted was accurate and did not cause errors like buffer overflow.
        </p>
        <p>
            This project was chosen because it effectively combines software application, data collecting, and testing. The artifact's junit tests, private helper methods, 
            suitable access modifiers, and parameter limitations demonstrate my capacity to create a logical, effective, and syntactically correct application. By extending the 
            scope of the search modules and junit tests, the artifact is enhanced.
        </p>
        <p>
            The assert true method that a variable was inside its anticipated parameters was the main focus of JUnit tests in the first project. 
            I added twice as many JUnit tests with an assert false function to check for data that wasn't covered by my previous tests. Additionally, new variables were added, 
            such as the first and last names to attach to the list that tracked my medical app's appointments. I included a number of other search techniques that applied to all 
            the other variables provided. Originally, this list was just intended to be used to seek for a unique identity by searching through the list. 
            The majority of the course goals were fulfilled for this item. My project's syntax was enhanced and its scope was broadened. As of right now, my outcome-coverage strategies have not been updated.
        </p>
        <p>
            When enhancing this project I learned to stay within the bounds of the project and not to become too ambitions. The areas of my project that I focused on seemed like they were 
            common sense improvements and extensions. It also helped that I hadn’t looked at my project for some months and could look at it with fresh eyes. The only challenges that I faced 
            were attempting to get tests to function properly and test the correct data.

        <h3>Databases – CS 340 Animal Rescue Dashboard</h3>
        <p>
            A project from CS-340 that was finished in 2024 used as the artifact for the databases category. 
            It is a Python file that serves as the back-end framework of an interactive database for animal rescue organizations 
            by interacting with Pymongo. While the post-enhancement artifact has more sophisticated SQL operations, the pre-enhancement 
            artifact only has basic CRUD capability.
        </p>
        <p>
            This project is a great illustration of how databases are built at the back end, which is why it was chosen as 
            my third artifact. Common languages like Python are used to search and edit the data in these databases. Significant 
            changes were made to my artifact throughout the enhancement phase, including the addition of create, read, update, and 
            delete SQL capability as well as other enhancements like count, insert multiple, update multiple, and delete multiple commands. 
            These improvements demonstrate how SQL and Python data structure code may be updated and expanded upon.
        </p>
        <p>
            For this milestone, I believe I have fulfilled all of the course goals. I added count, delete many, insert multiple, 
            and update multiple SQL commands to my artifact's capabilities and increased its complexity. As of right now, my outcome 
            coverage policies have not been update
        </p>
        <p>
            I gained an appreciation for both simple and sophisticated SQL commands while improving my project, particularly with 
            regard to CRUD (create, read, update, and delete). In my initial effort, I was able to establish a working database for 
            animal rescues by simply including those four SQL procedures into my Python code. I discovered how much a few tweaks may 
            improve my project's final design once I updated my code.

        <h3>Software Design and Engineering – 3D Office Scene</h3>
        <p>
            A graphical program created with OpenGL for the CS 330: Computational Graphics and Visualization course is called the 3D Office Scene 
            made in 2024. The original goal of the project was to illustrate fundamental ideas in computer graphics, such as scene design, lighting, 
            texturing, camera movement, and 3D transformations. The artifact allows the user to interactively traverse a virtual office setting made up 
            of several things placed in a three-dimensional area. In order to better represent professional software engineering techniques, this project
            which was finished earlier in class now was reexamined in CS 499.
        </p>
        <p>
            I choose to include this artifact in my ePortfolio because it effectively demonstrates my skills in applied mathematics, modular programming, 
            and software design inside a sophisticated visual system. Through the separation of rendering functionality from application control, organized 
            scene management, and reusable object classes, the project demonstrates object-oriented design. Particular elements like shader programs, lighting 
            computations, camera controls, and texture mapping demonstrate my comprehension of both higher-level architectural choices and low-level graphics pipelines. 
            By increasing lighting realism, reorganizing rendering components into more modular structures, and restructuring code for clarity and maintainability, 
            the improvement phase enhanced the artifact. Refactoring, performance awareness, debugging graphical systems, and applying design concepts to an existing 
            codebase are all demonstrated by these improvements.
        </p>
        <p>
            Enhancing this artifact was a valuable learning experience that reinforced the importance of clean architecture and iterative improvement in software development. 
            One of the main challenges was modifying and extending existing graphics code without breaking rendering behavior, which required careful testing and incremental 
            changes. I learned how small changes in shaders, transformations, or lighting calculations can have significant visual effects, emphasizing the need for precision 
            and documentation. My improvement technique was shaped by teacher instruction and feedback from the initial project, especially in terms of increasing the organization 
            and clarity of the code. Through this process, I partially met course outcomes related to cross-platform optimization and documentation depth, which could be further 
            improved with more time and testing. However, I fully met course outcomes related to software design, problem-solving, and the application of computing principles.

<section id="enhancements">
    <h2>Enhancements and Learning Outcomes</h2>
    <p>
        Enhancements were made to all artifacts with the goal of increasing user experience, scalability, and efficiency. 
        I created effective sorting algorithms to enhance data organization and substituted hash maps for list-based storage in the algorithms 
        artifact to achieve constant-time lookups.
    </p>
    <p>
       I extended the project into a full-stack application for the database artifact by combining an interactive HTML and JavaScript frontend 
        with a Flask backend. This made it possible to use MongoDB for data visualization, sophisticated querying, and real-time filtering.
    </p>
    <p>
        I gained a deeper comprehension of algorithmic analysis, database integration, full-stack development, and professional software engineering 
        methods thanks to these improvements. All of these projects show that I am prepared to create, evaluate, and apply scalable computer science solutions.
