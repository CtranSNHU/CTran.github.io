    <h2>Introduction</h2>
    <p>
        My name is Christian Tran attending Southern New Hampshire University majoring in Computer Science for my Bachelor's degree. 
        I have practical expertise with database-driven applications, algorithms and data structures, and software engineering. I have 
        improved my capacity to create scalable systems and creating data-driven applications that are useful in the real world through 
        my courses and ePortfolio building. This portfolio demonstrates my improvement during the curriculum and my preparedness for a career 
        in software development.

    <h2>Code Review Overview</h2>
    <p>
        My name is Christian Tran attending Southern New Hampshire University majoring in Computer Science for my Bachelor's degree. 
        I have practical expertise with database-driven applications, algorithms and data structures, and software engineering. I have 
        improved my capacity to create scalable systems and creating data-driven applications that are useful in the real world through my 
        courses and ePortfolio building. This portfolio demonstrates my improvement during the curriculum and my preparedness for a career in 
        software development.
    </p>
    <p>
        Working in a collaborative setting has also given me a greater appreciation for the opportunity to have my work reviewed by a different person.
        I frequently become too attached to a project and lose my capacity to examine it objectively, but having a second reviewer may point out errors 
        that I was unaware of and offer suggestions for potential fixes. The ability to interact with stakeholders and learn what they want from a project 
        has also been a focus of my work in this class, and it has strengthened my conviction that the most crucial stage of the software development lifecycle 
        is when the project's requirements are determined through discussion with stakeholders, programmers, project leads, and end users.

    <h2>Artifacts</h2>

    <div class="artifact">
        <h3>Algorithms and Data Structures – CS 320 Final Project</h3>
        <p>
            This artifact consists of service-based classes used to manage contacts, tasks, and
            appointments. The original implementation relied primarily on list-based storage and
            linear searches to manage data. While functional, this design presented scalability
            limitations as data volume increased.
        </p>
        <p>
            I selected this artifact because it clearly demonstrates foundational algorithmic
            concepts and provides an ideal opportunity to showcase performance optimization through
            improved data structures and sorting algorithms.
        </p>

    <div class="artifact">
        <h3>Databases – CS 340 Animal Rescue Dashboard</h3>
        <p>
            This project is a MongoDB-driven web dashboard designed to manage and visualize animal
            rescue data. It implements full CRUD functionality and allows users to interact with a
            NoSQL database through a user-facing interface.
        </p>
        <p>
            This artifact was selected because it demonstrates my ability to integrate databases with
            application logic and user interfaces, making complex datasets accessible and actionable
            through filtering and visualization.
        </p>

    <div class="artifact">
        <h3>Software Design and Engineering – 3D Office Scene</h3>
        <p>
            This artifact focuses on software architecture and graphical rendering using modular
            object-oriented design. The project demonstrates scene organization, rendering logic,
            and reusable components within a graphics application.
        </p>
        <p>
            It was chosen to represent my growth in software design principles, modularization, and
            maintainable code structures within a more complex system.

<section id="enhancements">
    <h2>Enhancements and Learning Outcomes</h2>
    <p>
        Across all artifacts, enhancements focused on improving efficiency, scalability, and user
        experience. In the algorithms artifact, I replaced list-based storage with hash maps to
        achieve constant-time lookups and implemented efficient sorting algorithms to improve data
        organization.
    </p>
    <p>
        For the database artifact, I expanded the project into a full-stack application by
        integrating a Flask backend with an interactive HTML and JavaScript frontend. This enabled
        real-time filtering, advanced querying, and data visualization using MongoDB.
    </p>
    <p>
        Through these enhancements, I strengthened my understanding of algorithmic analysis,
        database integration, full-stack development, and professional software engineering
        practices. These projects collectively demonstrate my readiness to design, analyze, and
        implement scalable computer science solutions.
