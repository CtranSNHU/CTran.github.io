    <h2>Introduction</h2>
    <p>
        This ePortfolio highlights my growth throughout the Computer Science program and showcases
        my technical skills through carefully selected and enhanced projects. Each artifact
        demonstrates my ability to design, analyze, and improve software solutions with a focus on
        real-world problem solving, efficiency, and maintainability.
    </p>
</section>

<section id="code-review">
    <h2>Code Review Overview</h2>
    <p>
        Prior to enhancing each artifact, I conducted a structured code review to evaluate existing
        functionality, identify areas for improvement, and plan targeted enhancements. This process
        allowed me to assess code quality, efficiency, data handling, and architectural decisions
        while aligning each enhancement with program learning outcomes.
    </p>
    <p>
        The code review phase emphasized refactoring opportunities, performance improvements, and
        scalability concerns. By documenting weaknesses and improvement strategies early, I was able
        to approach enhancements methodically and ensure that changes provided measurable technical
        value rather than superficial modifications.

    <h2>Artifacts</h2>

    <div class="artifact">
        <h3>Algorithms and Data Structures – CS 320 Final Project</h3>
        <p>
            This artifact consists of service-based classes used to manage contacts, tasks, and
            appointments. The original implementation relied primarily on list-based storage and
            linear searches to manage data. While functional, this design presented scalability
            limitations as data volume increased.
        </p>
        <p>
            I selected this artifact because it clearly demonstrates foundational algorithmic
            concepts and provides an ideal opportunity to showcase performance optimization through
            improved data structures and sorting algorithms.

    <div class="artifact">
        <h3>Databases – CS 340 Animal Rescue Dashboard</h3>
        <p>
            This project is a MongoDB-driven web dashboard designed to manage and visualize animal
            rescue data. It implements full CRUD functionality and allows users to interact with a
            NoSQL database through a user-facing interface.
        </p>
        <p>
            This artifact was selected because it demonstrates my ability to integrate databases with
            application logic and user interfaces, making complex datasets accessible and actionable
            through filtering and visualization.
        </p>

    <div class="artifact">
        <h3>Software Design and Engineering – 3D Office Scene</h3>
        <p>
            This artifact focuses on software architecture and graphical rendering using modular
            object-oriented design. The project demonstrates scene organization, rendering logic,
            and reusable components within a graphics application.
        </p>
        <p>
            It was chosen to represent my growth in software design principles, modularization, and
            maintainable code structures within a more complex system.

<section id="enhancements">
    <h2>Enhancements and Learning Outcomes</h2>
    <p>
        Across all artifacts, enhancements focused on improving efficiency, scalability, and user
        experience. In the algorithms artifact, I replaced list-based storage with hash maps to
        achieve constant-time lookups and implemented efficient sorting algorithms to improve data
        organization.
    </p>
    <p>
        For the database artifact, I expanded the project into a full-stack application by
        integrating a Flask backend with an interactive HTML and JavaScript frontend. This enabled
        real-time filtering, advanced querying, and data visualization using MongoDB.
    </p>
    <p>
        Through these enhancements, I strengthened my understanding of algorithmic analysis,
        database integration, full-stack development, and professional software engineering
        practices. These projects collectively demonstrate my readiness to design, analyze, and
        implement scalable computer science solutions.
